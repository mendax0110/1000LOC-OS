# Writing a Small OS Inspired by "Operating System in 1,000 Lines"

This project is based on the guide from the repository [nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines](https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines). The guide provides a step-by-step approach to writing a minimal operating system in just 1,000 lines of code. Using their methodology and reference implementation, I followed along and successfully built my own small OS.

## What I Did
- Studied the guide and reference implementation.
- Followed the provided steps to implement essential OS components.
- Wrote my own version of a minimal operating system based on their structure.
- Learned about bootloaders, memory management, user mode, and process handling.

## Key Features of My OS
- Basic kernel functionality
- Simple shell interface
- User-mode execution
- Minimal system calls

## Resources Used
- [Operating System in 1,000 Lines Guide](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/)
- Reference implementation from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines)

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to [nuta](https://github.com/nuta) and all contributors for their excellent documentation and reference implementation that made this project possible.

## Future Improvements
- Expand system call support
- Add a simple file system
- Implement basic multitasking
